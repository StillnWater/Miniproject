# Miniproject
Practicing tools for Programming, Learning, and Collaboration

# 1. Introduction
Modern software development is not limited to writing code; it requires a strong understanding of integrated development environments, version control, documentation, and collaborative workflows. In this assignment, a mini-project was created using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub to simulate real-world development practices.
The goal of this assignment was to build a simple yet functional Python Calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. The project was developed using VS Code, version-controlled using Git commands, and hosted in a public GitHub repository. Proper documentation and repository structure were also maintained as per professional standards.

# 2. Project Selection and Description
Selected Project: Python Calculator
The selected mini-project is a console-based Calculator written in Python.
It performs:
•	Addition
•	Subtraction
•	Multiplication
•	Division
•	Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero
This project is ideal for understanding basic programming concepts, modular code design, and Git workflow.
